// The only place a unit conversion is spelled out.
//
// This codebase mixes four units — Three.js scene feet, spec inches, offset
// millimetres and angles — and the type system cannot tell a number in one from
// a number in another. Names carry the unit (see CONVENTIONS.md §5) and every
// crossing between them goes through a function here, so there is one place to
// be wrong rather than a dozen.

// Exported for the few places that need the factor rather than a conversion —
// scaling a loaded model, or dividing a whole vector — so even those do not
// respell the number.
